==========

This repo provides a Python 2.7 gnuradio script named osmotcp.py.
The script serves samples from any gr-osmosdr supported device
over TCP/IP.  The server supports the RTL\_TCP protocol.  In addition
the output stream can be configured to send either signed words or floating point
IQ samples -- not just the default unsigned byte IQ samples of RTL\_TCP.
